task 2
In task2, I creat a function called initialize_opinions at first to make random opinions for every person in the grid. Then, I use  change_opinions function to random choose people and their neighbor, then compare opinions because big different of  them can not communicate with each other, and calculate the opinions. It could simulates their interactions over a specified number of time steps. After this I draw graph of them. In the test defuant part, I use 4 default numbers of  coupling and Threshold to make 4 original graph.
